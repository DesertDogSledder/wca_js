When an android self-destructs, it spends two actions to activate the systems and then explodes at the start of its next turn. It causes 1d6 heat damage per size category to all within 30&apos;. Alternatively, it is possible to automate the self-destruct system to activate when the android reaches zero HEALTH."

The weapon must be the same size category as the android or smaller, and worth 100cr or less.
