They were the first dwarves, but the Creator abandoned them in the primordial fires, considering them a failed experiment.\n\nAll obsidian dwarves practice rituals that humans would call cannibalism. In its purest form, the Rites of Consumption honor the fallen. Though the Rites are often misunderstood, obsidian dwarves do not eat the flesh of intelligent creatures as an act of evil or intimidation; it is their way of honoring life, death, and rebirth. Obsidian dwarves have no grave sites; family members are consumed by their clan and their stony bones are displayed in their hall.\n\nAn obsidian dwarf&apos;s black skin is perfectly smooth and glassy, and flickers beautifully in firelight. Their eyes reflect their fiery heritage, like black coals or scarlet embers. Their hair may be wild and tangled, but can be dreadlocked, singed by fire, or ritually burned away.",

They are as generous as they are jovial, and always happy to welcome others to their homes: indeed, entertaining others is a prime instinct for the smallfolk.\n\nMany view the smallfolk as weak, sometimes even cowardly. While it is true that the race does not tend towards violence, a cornered smallfolk will defend his or her friends to the death.
