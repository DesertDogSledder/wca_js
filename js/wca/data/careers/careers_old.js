Clerics are also trained to be capable warriors, able to defend themselves physically if their spells fail them. Since clerics deal more in abstract realms of the soul and the spirit, their magic has a definite slant toward the intangible, generally eschewing direct offensive magic in favor of spells that affect creatures&apos; essence and behavior, or that make creatures more or less able to battle. Most clerics worship one specific deity from a pantheon, but still respect other members of that pantheon, even if they are not actual followers. The agendas of deities&apos; worshippers may conflict in the realm of mortals, but it is folly to defy even enemy deities. Thus, though a cleric may choose to change the deity he or she reveres, if the clerics truly abandons the pantheon, he or she will never be accepted by any deity, being forced to rely on mortal magic alone.",

Inquisitors learn their spells from copies of old spellbooks, scribed by the founders of the Inquisitorial order centuries ago.
